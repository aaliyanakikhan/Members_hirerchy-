# Members_hirerchy-
This project is a Member Hierarchy Management System using PHP OOP, MySQL with PDO, and jQuery. It displays members in a recursive tree, allows adding new members via a popup dialog, and updates dynamically with jQuery append. Files are modular: db.php for PDO connection, Member.php for recursion, insert.php for AJAX, and index.php for UI.
